## 2026-02-20
- Built a complete parallel `24V candidate` architecture package while preserving canonical `48V` docs:
- `docs/variants/24v/ELECTRICAL_24V_vs_48V_trade_study.md`
- `docs/variants/24v/SYSTEMS_24V_candidate.md`
- `docs/variants/24v/ELECTRICAL_overview_diagram_24V_candidate.md`
- `docs/variants/24v/ELECTRICAL_fuse_schedule_24V_candidate.md`
- `docs/variants/24v/DECISION_SCORECARD_24V_vs_48V.md`
- `bom/variants/24v/bom_estimated_items_24V_candidate.csv`
- `bom/variants/24v/load_model_wh_24V_candidate.csv`
- Added `24V_CANDIDATE_STATUS` tags for architecture-sensitive BOM rows and appended explicit `ADD` rows (`124-126`) for candidate-specific migration scope.
- Added metadata/status rows to both variant CSVs while preserving header schema.
- Included required decision calculations in the scorecard (`2.5kW` inverter current, Ah sizing, MPPT clipping, alternator current, residual 12V budget).
- Captured same-day live pricing references in candidate trade-study/scorecard docs with vendor links.
- Updated `docs/TRACKING.md` with decision `D-024` documenting candidate-package creation and canonical unchanged status.
- Measurements/data: weighted score outcome from candidate scorecard = `24V 79.9` vs `48V 74.7` (gap `5.2`).
- Tests run:
- CSV header parity check between canonical and candidate files.
- Load-model scenario total verification (candidate totals still `3,530 / 4,202 / 624 Wh/day`).
- Candidate BOM status-tag presence check for required rows.
- Issues: none blocking; live-market prices are snapshot values and expected to drift.
- Next actions: either promote candidate docs to canonical or keep as analysis branch pending final owner lock.

## 2026-02-16
- Updated procurement sequencing to an accelerated `Batch A+` phase so the electrical bench build can start without waiting for later cable/consumable waves.
- Updated `bom/bom_estimated_items.csv` purchase windows:
- `2026-02-16`: rows `3`, `12`, `18`, `20`, `22`, `23`
- `2026-02-17`: rows `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `10`, `11`, `16`, `17`, `26`, `27`
- `2026-02-18`: rows `52`, `53`, `60`
- `2026-02-19`: rows `28`, `29`, `30`, `31`, `32`, `33`
- `2026-02-20`: rows `34`, `35`, `36`, `37`, `38`, `39`, `40`, `41`
- `2026-02-21`: rows `42`, `43`, `44`, `45`
- Restored missing BOM row `122` as a placeholder interior procurement line item for drawer-slide kits so canonical row references remain coherent.
- Synchronized planning/governance docs:
- `docs/PROJECT_build_order_of_operations.md` updated from `Batch A` to `Batch A+` and adjusted downstream batch scope.
- `docs/PROJECT.md` sequencing baseline updated to `2026-02-16` with active `Batch A+` note.
- `docs/TRACKING.md` updated with decisions `D-019` and `D-020`.
- Measurements/data: none captured (documentation/procurement-plan update only).
- Tests run: row-level verification of targeted BOM date updates (`37` checks, `0` mismatches).
- Issues: initial BOM write attempt was blocked by a temporary file lock; write succeeded after lock release.
- Next actions: convert planned purchase dates to actual ordered status with vendor + ETA per row and identify any SKU substitutions before harness fabrication.

## 2026-02-15
- Performed integrated safety deep-dive for the current architecture with focus on the `48V 10.24kWh` system plus `12V`, `120VAC`, and propane paths.
- Expanded `docs/SYSTEMS.md` `## Safety` from placeholder bullets to a build-ready baseline covering:
- system-wide controls and isolation/access principles
- `48V` high-fault-current hazard controls and commissioning checks
- `12V` distribution protections and Orion headroom safety trigger
- `120VAC` protection-chain and commissioning test requirements
- propane rear-mount/passthrough controls and indoor water-heater selection rule
- emergency shutdown order and pre-close safety hold points
- Updated governance in `docs/TRACKING.md`:
- Added decision `D-015` (consolidated safety baseline adoption)
- Added risks `R-007` (`48V` arc/thermal fault exposure), `R-008` (propane/CO exposure), and `R-009` (AC neutral-ground/GFCI protection risk)
- Added open questions to lock propane heater listing/venting path, passthrough hardware rules, leak-test cadence, and detector/extinguisher layout.
- Added operations-ready checklist content in `docs/OPERATIONS.md`:
- pre-energization checks
- propane-specific checks
- incident-response quick actions
- Measurements/data: none captured in this documentation pass.
- Tests run: none (documentation update only).
- Issues: final propane appliance path and venting method remain unresolved and now explicitly tracked.
- Next actions: convert safety hold points to dated commissioning test records during wiring and gas-system validation.

## 2026-02-13
- Ran PRF-003 research sweep focused on AC distribution right-sizing for the current truck-camper architecture.
- Reviewed current project AC assumptions in:
- `bom/bom_estimated_items.csv` (rows `13`, `14`, `15`, `67`, `68`)
- `bom/load_model_wh.csv` (owner-supplied office AC-path assumptions)
- `docs/ELECTRICAL_overview_diagram.md` (shore + inverter AC topology)
- Quantified modeled AC-related energy share at roughly `27.9%` (`core_workday`) to `30.7%` (`winter_workday`) for current assumptions.
- Updated `docs/TEMP_procurement_red_flags.md` PRF-003 to:
- Separate "AC safety requirements" from "panel size/mounting method" assumptions.
- Add confirmed Phase 1 AC load list and right-sized architecture options.
- Document that DIN rail is optional pending final enclosure choice.
- Keep PRF-003 open until AC topology lock and SKU lock are complete.
- Expanded `docs/ELECTRICAL_overview_diagram.md` AC section from high-level path to full hierarchy:
- Shore-source path, MultiPlus transfer/charger behavior, AC-out branch strategy, optional AC-out-2 handling, and USB-C PD strategy.
- Added AC operating-behavior notes, protection-chain requirements, procurement gap checklist, and detailed AC conductor-segment entries (`C-28` through `C-35`).
- Added new tracking open questions in `docs/TRACKING.md` for shore-interface lock (`15A` vs `30A`) and USB charging path lock (DC USB-C PD vs AC USB receptacles).
- Locked Phase 1 AC/USB baseline for procurement:
- AC-out-1 split into two branches (`20A` galley + `15A` office) with `4` total `120V` receptacle locations (`2` galley, `2` office).
- USB charging baseline locked to `4` DC-fed USB-C PD points (`2` office + `2` galley) on dedicated `12V` branches.
- Updated `bom/bom_estimated_items.csv`:
- Refined rows `13`, `14`, `15`, and `17`.
- Added rows `107-118` for shore interface, AC enclosure/protection, receptacle hardware, AC wire scope, USB-C PD hardware, and optional 12V-converter expansion path.
- Set USB-C PD zone design intent to two `10A` fused `12V` branches (office + galley) to keep demand aligned with current Orion headroom assumptions.
- Updated `docs/ELECTRICAL_overview_diagram.md` and `docs/ELECTRICAL_fuse_schedule.md` to map AC branches and USB-C PD branch circuits to the locked baseline.
- Added decision `D-013` in `docs/TRACKING.md` and replaced prior AC architecture open questions with a SKU-lock follow-up item.

## 2026-02-12
- Built RF-003 decision support for power-distribution topology in `docs/SYSTEMS.md`:
- Compared `DIY discrete` vs `Lynx one-module` vs `Lynx two-module`.
- Listed required component groupings for each topology.
- Added planning-level cost deltas using current BOM rows plus explicit Lynx price assumptions.
- Added clear decision rule for whether `1` Lynx is sufficient or when `2` is justified.
- Updated `docs/TEMP_electrical_red_flags.md` RF-003 references and status to `Open (decision-ready)`.
- Added high-level electrical architecture draft in `docs/ELECTRICAL_overview_diagram.md` using a topology-only Mermaid diagram.
- Linked the new diagram from `docs/SYSTEMS.md` and indexed it in `docs/README.md`.
- Kept this revision intentionally free of fuse/disconnect/wire-gauge details pending final topology lock.
- Performed full electrical-system sweep for fuse/holder/gauge consistency:
- Corrected Sterling `BB1248120` spec basis from `120A @ 48V` assumption to `~1500W` max output (`~26A` at `57.6V`) in `bom/bom_estimated_items.csv` and `docs/SYSTEMS.md`.
- Recalculated alternator charging replacement-time assumptions in `docs/SYSTEMS.md`.
- Replaced `docs/ELECTRICAL_overview_diagram.md` with implementation-level topology including all major components, fuse holders, and conductor schedule.
- Reworked `docs/ELECTRICAL_fuse_schedule.md` to include full fuse housing methods, branch gauge tie-ins, and sweep findings.
- Added decision `D-012` in `docs/TRACKING.md` and closed new red flag `RF-008` in `docs/TEMP_electrical_red_flags.md`.

## 2026-02-11
- Workspace structure simplified and consolidated for lower documentation overhead.

- Solar, alternator, and shore charging potential tables.
- Formula block and update workflow for future recalculation.
- Updated `docs/TRACKING.md` with:
- Decision D-003 (canonical maintained electrical model).
- Risk R-004 (inverter overload risk from simultaneous high-draw AC loads).
- Performed full electrical model reset from BOM source of truth:
- Temporary battery interpretation was set to `2x 51.2V 400Ah LiFePO4` (later corrected same day).
- Replaced `bom/load_model_wh.csv` with BOM-derived model v2 (`core_workday`, `winter_workday`, `minimal_idle_day`).

- Resolved RF-001 policy mismatch for owner-supplied office electronics:
- Kept owner devices out of BOM procurement cost tracking.
- Added explicit owner-supplied load rows (laptop, 27 inch 1440p monitor, tablet/peripherals) to `bom/load_model_wh.csv` model v3.
- Recalculated `docs/SYSTEMS.md` load totals, autonomy, and charging replacement times against model v3.

- Added decision D-008 in `docs/TRACKING.md` and closed RF-002 in `docs/TEMP_electrical_red_flags.md`.
- Added purchase-later vehicle charging upgrade path:
- Added JS high-output alternator (`$548`) and Big 3 wiring estimate (`$225`) to `bom/bom_estimated_items.csv`.
- Added Big 3 note to existing 2/0 cable row to indicate gauge compatibility and expected extra length when upgrade is activated.
