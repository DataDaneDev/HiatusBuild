# Hiatus Truck Bed Camper Project

This workspace is the single source of truth for planning, design, and execution of a full-time off-grid remote office build.

## Fixed project constants
- Truck: 2021 Ford F-350 Regular Cab Long Bed
- Truck mods: 2.5" lift, 37" tires, 4.88 differential regear
- Camper milestone: ready for install on May 7, 2026
- Primary use: Financial Analyst remote work (typical 9-5, Monday-Friday) with occasional subsidiary flights

## Workspace map (simplified)
- `docs/` project planning and design docs (consolidated into a few canonical files)
- `cad/` Fusion 360 sources and exports
- `bom/` bill of materials and procurement notes
- `logs/` build timeline and test evidence
- `media/` photos and inspiration references
- `references/` manuals, datasheets, external specs
- `Camper Build.xlsx` legacy planning workbook

## Working rule
Prefer updating existing canonical docs over creating new files. Keep context centralized unless a file becomes too large to manage.
