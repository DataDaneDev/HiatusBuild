# Build Notes

| A | B |
| --- | --- |
| Battery Heating | Battery box insulated and as small as practical |
| Use diesel heater ducting to warm the battery compartment (reroute heat hose) | Diesel heater duct branch into battery box with a closable vent |
| Battery box insulated (removable) | Temp sensor inside battery box (and ideally one touching a battery case) |
| Top -side of battery box has passive vents (don't vent onto the inverter…) | Sterling BB1248120 enable/control strategy tied to thermostat/relay logic if cold-charge lockout automation is used |
| Verify batt has BMS low-temp charge cutoff (and not discharge cutoff) |  |
| BBR remote on/off and current-limit presets? |  |
| Busbar |  |
| positive side: |  |
| 1. Battery + |  |
| 2. Class T fuse (225A) (within ~7") |  |
| 3. Battery disconnect |  |
| 4. 48V positive busbar |  |
| 5. From that busbar → fused feeds to: |  |
| MultiPlus-II (MEGA) |  |
| MPPT (MEGA) |  |
| Sterling BB1248120 branch (fuse sizing TBD from manual) |  |
| Sterling BBR remote harness/control line |  |
| 48→12 converter (MEGA) |  |
| Negative side: |  |
| 1. Battery – |  |
| 2. SmartShunt (goes in the negative line) |  |
| 3. 48V negative busbar |  |
| 4. From that busbar → negatives for all devices (MultiPlus, MPPT, Sterling charger, DC-DC) |  |
| Key rule: Everything except the battery negative must be “on the load side” of the SmartShunt so it can measure all current. |  |
| Linestone paint hybrid |  |
| LED strip running down just about bed rail, pointing up. Creates "big space" |  |
| 45 degree frosted LED |  |
| Phenolic Resin top / richlite |  |
| 3d/hexagon sound deadening |  |
| The Concept: A vertical 80/20 pillar with a gas-strut or linear actuator. |  |
| The Action: The monitor stows "face down" or "low-slung" near the desk surface during travel. Once popped, you slide the pillar up into the new vertical headspace. |  |
| When stowed, it acts as a vertical "shield" for your storage cubbies (the smoke-grey acrylic ones).  / When deployed, you pull a release, and the gas strut "assists" it into a horizontal position, bridging the aisle. |  |
| Adjustable Pneumatic Table Pedestal |  |
| 80/20 notes |  |
| Toe kick under bottom 80/20, raised off ground. Creates false bottom under  / cabinets for wiring, storage, etc. |  |
