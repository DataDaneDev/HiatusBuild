# Flooring Subfloor Build Process

## Scope
- Define the locked floor stack-up, hardpoint strategy, procurement state, and install workflow for the truck bed floor.
- Baseline date for this revision: February 26, 2026.

## Final Subfloor Structure (Bottom to Top)
1. Existing spray-in bedliner.
2. `5/8 in` SilveRboard Graphite EPS between ribs only.
3. `1/8 in` EPDM closed-cell sheet across full bed area.
4. `1/2 in` exterior/APA sheathing plywood, sealed both sides and all edges.
5. Lonseal Lonwood Madera marine sheet vinyl, glue-down finish layer.

## Hardpoint Rule (Structural Anchors)
- At structural hardpoints, remove EPS and EPDM locally so plywood bears directly on steel.
- Use mechanical fasteners into rivnuts at these pockets.
- Do not place compressible insulation in bolt clamp stacks.

## Procurement Snapshot (Corrected)
### Purchased
- SilveRboard Graphite EPS kit (`$71.38`) - Home Depot.
- Rubber-Cal EPDM closed-cell sponge rubber, qty 2 (`$47.22`) - Home Depot.
- Loctite PL 300 foamboard adhesive (`$5.48`) - Home Depot.
- TotalBoat Halcyon Water-Based Marine Varnish, clear gloss, pint (`$22.99`) - Amazon.

### Not Yet Purchased
- Lonseal Lonwood Madera marine sheet vinyl (`$374.08` expected).
- `1/2 in` APA sheathing plywood (estimate `~$50-$60` total).
- Sheet-vinyl adhesive/sealant (estimate `~$40-$70`).

### Totals
- Purchased to date for flooring package: `$147.07`.
- Additional expected spend for unpurchased flooring items: about `$464.08-$504.08`.
- Estimated full flooring package total: about `$611.15-$651.15`.

## Installation Sequence
### Phase 1 - Prep
1. Clean bed thoroughly.
2. Measure rib depth.
3. Mark structural hardpoints (tank frame anchors and other fixed anchors).

### Phase 2 - Between-Rib Insulation
1. Cut EPS to snug fit between ribs.
2. Apply PL 300 in light dabs only (`3-5` dabs per cavity).
3. Press foam into place; avoid full-surface bonding.

### Phase 3 - Full Thermal Break Layer
1. Lay `1/8 in` EPDM across the full bed.
2. Trim perimeter.
3. Cut hardpoint pockets where structural anchors are required.

### Phase 4 - Subfloor
1. Cut plywood panels and drill anchor-hole layout.
2. Remove panels and seal all faces and edges with polyurethane.
3. Allow full cure.
4. Install rivnuts in steel at hardpoint locations.
5. Clear insulation at hardpoint pockets so plywood sits directly on steel there.
6. Reinstall plywood and bolt structural hardpoints.

### Phase 5 - Finish Flooring
1. Dry-fit Lonseal sheet and align grain/pattern.
2. Apply adhesive per Lonseal adhesive manufacturer specification.
3. Lay vinyl and roll thoroughly.
4. Trim edges and allow cure before loading furniture.

## Final Build Height
- EPS: `0.625 in`
- EPDM: `0.125 in`
- Plywood: `0.500 in`
- Vinyl: `0.080 in`
- Total: approximately `1.33 in`

Confirm final door and tank clearances against this stack-up before permanent installation.

## Engineering Notes
- Thermal performance: strong floor thermal decoupling for vehicle use.
- Structural behavior: correct load transfer when hardpoint pocket rule is followed.
- Moisture durability: closed-cell layers plus sealed plywood improve moisture resilience.
- Acoustic behavior: EPDM layer helps reduce floor drumming and vibration.
- Serviceability: only finish vinyl is permanently bonded; lower layers remain serviceable.
