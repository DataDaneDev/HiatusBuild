# Docs Overview

Use these files as canonical sources to keep context centralized and AI-friendly:

- `docs/PROJECT.md`: scope, requirements, milestones, constraints
- `docs/SYSTEMS.md`: electrical, solar, plumbing, comms, structure, cabinetry, HVAC, safety
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md`: checklists, maintenance, travel/flight procedures
- `docs/TRACKING.md`: decisions, risks, assumptions, templates, open questions

Rule: update one of these first before creating any new doc file.

Supplementary workbook extracts (non-canonical, for traceability):
- `docs/PROJECT_workbook_hiatus_consult.md`
- `docs/SYSTEMS_workbook_build_notes.md`
- `docs/SYSTEMS_workbook_electrical_notes.md`
- `docs/SYSTEMS_workbook_vecel_consult.md`
- `docs/OPERATIONS_workbook_marketplace_finds.md`
