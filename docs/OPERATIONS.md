# Operations

## Build and deployment cadence
- Weekly planning update in `docs/PROJECT.md`
- Continuous progress notes in `logs/LOG.md`
- Weekly risk/decision review in `docs/TRACKING.md`
- Reconcile workbook-derived CSV exports before major purchases (`bom/`)

## Pre-departure checklist (starter)
- Battery SOC and charging paths verified
- Communications primary and fallback validated
- Critical spares onboard (fuses, terminals, core tools)
- Workstation and data gear secured for travel

## Arrival/setup checklist (starter)
- Level/stabilize rig
- Check solar exposure and charging state
- Validate call-quality on primary and fallback links
- Confirm ventilation and thermal baseline

## Maintenance framework (starter)
- Electrical inspection interval: TBD
- Fastener and structure inspection interval: TBD
- Solar cleaning/inspection interval: TBD
- Cable chafe and connector condition checks: TBD

## Marketplace sourcing routine (from workbook)
- Daily 5-minute scan: 80/20 extrusion, RV water tank, sink/faucet, office chair, monitor arm, cooktop, fridge, diesel heater, camper parts.
- Save searches and enable notifications to capture liquidation listings quickly.
- Prioritize used-commercial office gear over consumer-tier furniture for daily work ergonomics.
- Use strict safety screening for electrical components, especially used batteries and charging hardware.

## Used-parts target pricing anchors
- 80/20 extrusion: target `$2-$4/ft` (vs higher retail).
- Plywood and hardwood: target `$40-$60/sheet` for usable cabinet-grade material.
- Office chair: target `$200-$400` for premium used models.
- Monitor arm: target `$50-$120` with adequate load rating.
- Water tank: target `$30-$100` with food-safe/NSF confirmation.
- Solar panels: target around `$0.30-$0.50/W` where condition is verified.

## Flight/travel handoff
- Secure shutdown checklist before leaving vehicle
- Storage/security procedure while away
- Carry-on vs checked equipment standard
